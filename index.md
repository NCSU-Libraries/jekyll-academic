excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a doctoral student and graduate research assistant under the guidance of Drs. [Micahel Colvin](https://mcolvin.github.io/) and [Leandro (Steve) Miranda](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/People/Leandro_Miranda/index.html). We're housed in the [Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department](http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/wildlife/) within the [College of Forest Resources](http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/) at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/). 

I was recently accepted to the position, so I'm still getting aquainted with the project supported by the [Mississippi Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/index.html) and the [Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks](http://www.mdwfp.com/). For now, I'll describe it as having a knowledge discovery and exploratory analysis project with an additional component to develope a web application for management decisions. 

This page is new, so be patient as I buildâ€”and check back for updates!
