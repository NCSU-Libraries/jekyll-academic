excerpt: "About Me..."

I am a doctoral student and graduate research assistant in the [Wildlife, Fisheries & Aquaculture Department (College of Forest Resources)](http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/wildlife/) and [Mississippi Cooperative Fish And Wildlife Research Unit](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/index.html) at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/), working under the guidance of Drs. [Michael Colvin](https://mcolvin.github.io/) and [Lenardo (Steve) Miranda](https://www.coopunits.org/Mississippi/People/Leandro_Miranda/index.html). As I have only recently begun in this position, there is little progress to report; the gist of the project, though, is to explore long-term fisheries data and build a fisheries management decision application.
