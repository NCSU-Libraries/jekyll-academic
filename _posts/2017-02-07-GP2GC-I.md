## Setting the stage(coach)

> Quick note: This is the first of a short series of posts I am doing on a trip I and family took in August of 2016 and it may be a little longer and sappier than most are willing to endure. I lack the abilities of a good writer, so if you'd like to see photographs of our trip scroll to the bottom. After all, "One picture [is] worth ten thousand words" (Fred R. Barnard, 1927).

I had the privilege of visiting the national park on a whirlwind trip with my future wife, her father and sister, and one of their close family friends in the spring of 2015. I knew then that I wanted my family to visit the same amazing places, _viz._ Grand Canyon National Park (NP), Zion NP, Bryce Canyon NP, Capitol Reef NP, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Canyonlands NP, Arches NP, and all the beautiful landscapes in between. I knew this would be a big undertakingâ€”my family lives in a quiet, rural community where most are content and happy to live out their days without grand adventures (much like hobbits). Nevertheless, Christmas 2015 I ask for my paternal grandparents to visit the Grand Canyon as my gift that year.

I hoped in some way it would be received without hesitation but knew there would be a myriad of excuses of why they shouldn't leave to go adventuring in far away lands. (To my later discovery, Poppa had never been more than a couple hundred miles from where he was born and raised and my Nana hadn't ventured much further).

> "Who will check on so-and-so? Who will tend to the garden? What about church bread?" (My grandparents' Church observes the Lord's Supper weekly, so someone must prepare unleavened bread for the ceremony.)
_So-and-so has other friends. God and siblings can tend the garden. And, the other saints are very capable of following your recipe._

> "When will we even go? How will we get there? Who will go with us?"
_In the summer; train, plane, bus, or boat; anyone you need to get you there. I of course wanted and planned to go with them all along._

The questions and excuses steadily faded as plans materialized. First week of August, by vehicle, eight (sometimes nine) trip-goers, and excitement all around.

## "Two roads diverged"

### A pit-stop
My Poppa is a reserved person, at least until you spark a topic of conversation in which he is passionate. He then transforms from a seemingly quiet, simple, strong-gripped member of the country-folk to a passionate and wise intellectual. Though his occupation was that of a machinist and welder, a fervent will to read and learn makes him as knowledgeable and entertaining as any university lecturer. His area of expertise, however, can't be easily classified into an academic department.

My Nana is a kind and mostly gentle person. I said kind because, though she is nice, she will offer advice or support that is helpful not just sweet. Sharp as a tack. She can manage almost any group of people through almost any formidable terrain (working as a postmaster for 20+ years lends proof to your substance). I watched her carry her family through its toughest times, but always with gentleness and understanding. Sometimes coming from nothing compels one to give all you have to others.

### Back on track

At this point plans have been made and bags are almost packed when Poppa shows concern about the route to be taken. His reasoning is that we can broaden our sightseeing experience if we taken two different routes to and fro. An excellent suggestion. So, on the "to" to we decided to leave from our family's property in northwest Alabama headed west-southwest through Dallas, TX then west-northwest to Flagstaff, AZ (pictures with captions below). The "fro" would be to loop back through Farmington, NM and stay Interstate 40 till Memphis, TN and US-78/I-22 home.

The first leg of the trip would get us to Amarillo, TX and be the most drastic change in vegetation for the time/distance traveled. It became really apparent the morning of day two when light allowed us to really take in the scrub type landscape. (I really wish I would have taken more pictures of the trip out).
