I got a thumbs up from my grandparents on [my first blog post](aldridgecaleb.github.io/_posts/2018-02-07_GPtoGC_ZNP.md) which featured pictures from Zion National Park on our "big trip" out west. So, I've decided to create a short series of post around that trip and the places we visited. Today's pictures, Bryce Canyon National Park.
