## Lee's Ferry and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (red cliffs)

At the end of [Part II](https://aldridgecaleb.github.io/blog/GP2GC-II/) in this series we had just been floored by the majesty of the Grand Canyon. From the South Rim Visitors Center we were making our way west on HWY-89; our last stop was the Desert Watchtower. We were now driving towards Page, AZ, but would head west on HWY-89A before reaching the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell.

United States Highway-89 Alternate detours from HWY-89 about 30 miles south of Page, AZ, paralleling the contact point between the grayish-tan Permian Sedimentary Rocks and the reds of the Moenkopi, Chinle, and Glen Canyon formations ([AZGS, 2013](http://data.azgs.az.gov/geologic-map-of-arizona/)). (You can see the colors from satellite imagery, just take a look at the Google map below with our route in blue). This area is better know as the [Vermilion Cliffs](https://www.blm.gov/visit/vermilion-cliffs), [Marble Canyon](http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/vermilion_cliffs/national_monument.html), or sometimes the Red Cliffs. HWY-89A then crossed the Colorado River at [Lee's Ferry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%27s_Ferry), a unique geographic location where the river is easily crossed. Because it is literally the easiest access and crossing point for dozens, if not hundreds, of miles, making Lee's Ferry a culturally, historically, and politically important place.

Poppa recalled how it "was a military outpost and the only way to cross the river until the [[historic] Navajo Bridge](https://www.nps.gov/glca/learn/historyculture/navajobridge.htm) was built in the 1920s or 30s;" he wasn't exactly sure, he said. Both the historic and modern bridges dwarf any we have near home---830+ ft. in length and ~470 ft. above the river. The engineering spectacle, however, was outdone by the breathtaking scenery.
